Cool use of ChatGPT for data imputation! You seem to have passion for data as evidenced by your attention to detail and willingness to dig deeper into da:ta sources!
Your code style is also great; very clean and readable. Some things to fix up:
- Q3.1, 3.2, 3.4: a good rule of thumb for when you see datapoints bunched up is to try plotting either the X or Y axis (or both) on a log scale

For question 3.1, I added a scatter plot on a log-log scale, but didn't remove the original one in order to illustrate the problem of computing the correlation without taking out Kuwait (on a linear scale, the "outlierness" of Kuwait, and hence its impact on the correlation, is clearer).

In question 3.2, I removed the scatter plot entirely, as it's not strictly necessary.

In question 3.4, I adopted a log-log scale for the plot.

- Q3.4: There are no grey dots on the plot, which means there are no countries with an NA continent that have non NA data for GDP and CO2 emissions. You could `.dropna()` so NA doesn't show up on the legend

I discarded rows with any of the three columns (continent, GDP per capita, and CO emissions) with missing data.

- Q3.5: Similar to the scatter plots, when you see data points bunched up, it was worth trying to plot the Y-axis on a log scale

I tried this suggestion. While it's true that a log scale de-compresses some of the boxes (especially Africa), I still prefer to keep the linear scale. Keeping the original scale makes it easier to realize that variances across groups (continents) is very different, which in turn supports my decision about not using ANOVA to find an effect of `continent` on the mean Energy use per capita.

- Q3.7: While Monaco and Macao are the correct-ish conclusions, the table is not quite what is being asked for. This is not quite right:
	- For each year, assign a rank value to each country where the country with the largest population density has rank 1, 2nd largest has rank 2 etc.
		- This means country X might have 1962 = 5, 1967 = 7,  etc.
	- Create a new column that takes the average of all rank values for each country
		- So for country X, it's average rank is "5 + 7 + ..." divided  by "number of timepoints"

Yes, somehow I didn't follow exactly what was being asked. I implemented these changes. However, I'm not sure what the reviewer mean by *correct-ish*, since the conclusion is the same: Macao and Monaco are in a tie, since both have an average 1.5 rank over the years. These two countries alternate in being the most densely populated country. I illustrate this in an additional table.

- Q3.8: I think it would've been more appropriate to only plot the top 10 or 20 for legibility. Just looking at the difference between 1967 to 2007 would've been fine, but it great that you noticed that other years could have lower values than 1967.

I agree in that the line plot looks a bit messy, it's very crowded. Still, it was meant to produce an overview of the data regarding the variable of interest (and its evolution over time). I'm not sure that filtering the data in advance would have enabled me to realize that there were some countries displaying a different pattern in the evolution of Life Expectancy.
