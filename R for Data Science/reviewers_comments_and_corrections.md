Cool use of ChatGPT for data imputation! You seem to have passion for data as evidenced by your attention to detail and willingness to dig deeper into da:ta sources!
Your code style is also great; very clean and readable. Some things to fix up:
- Q3.1, 3.2, 3.4: a good rule of thumb for when you see datapoints bunched up is to try plotting either the X or Y axis (or both) on a log scale
- Q3.4: There are no grey dots on the plot, which means there are no countries with an NA continent that have non NA data for GDP and CO2 emissions. You could `.dropna()` so NA doesn't show up on the legend
- Q3.5: Similar to the scatter plots, when you see data points bunched up, it was worth trying to plot the Y-axis on a log scale
- Q3.7: While Monaco and Macao are the correct-ish conclusions, the table is not quite what is being asked for. This is not quite right:
	- For each year, assign a rank value to each country where the country with the largest population density has rank 1, 2nd largest has rank 2 etc.
		- This means country X might have 1962 = 5, 1967 = 7,  etc.
	- Create a new column that takes the average of all rank values for each country
		- So for country X, it's average rank is "5 + 7 + ..." divided  by "number of timepoints"
- Q3.8: I think it would've been more appropriate to only plot the top 10 or 20 for legibility. Just looking at the difference between 1967 to 2007 would've been fine, but it great that you noticed that other years could have lower values than 1967.
